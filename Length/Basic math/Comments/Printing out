# JavaScript (LENGTH, BASIC MATH, ERROR: DOES NOT COMPUTE, COMMENTS, CONFRIM, PROMPT, PRINTING OUT)
JavaScript lectures

LENGTH
"stanko".length --> To discover the length of your name write your name within quotes.

BASIC MATH: 3 + 4 --> no need to add anything special

ERROR: DOES NOT COMPUTE --> If you use words that aren't in the JavaScript language, it will get confused and give you an error.

COMMENTS --> you have to use // before writing a comment inside the editor. This won't be read as a code. It's solely for humans.

*confirm('This is an example of using JS to create some interaction on a website. Click OK to continue!');* --> These boxes can be used on websites to confirm things with users.

Programs need an input so work. To ASK for an INPUT you can do it with PROMPT --> *prompt("Where are you from?");*

PRINTING OUT: CONSOLE.LOG("..") --> indise you can put sentences, do math etc.

LIST OF COMPARISON OPERATORS: <= less than or equal to, >= greater than or equal to, === equal to, !== NOT equal to
primer: console.log("Stanko".length === 6) and on console appears TRUE
