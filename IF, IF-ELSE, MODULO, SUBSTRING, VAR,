PART 2 (DECISIONS - IF, IF / ELSE, MODULO - %, SUBSTRINGS, VARIABLES

DECISIONS - IF:
if( "myName".length >= 7 ) {
    console.log("You have a long name!");
} ---> If the answer to the condition is yes, the code inside the curly braces will run.

IF / ELSE:
if( "myName".length >= 7 ) {
    console.log("You have a long name!");
}
else {
    console.log("You have a short name!");  
} --> If the condition is true first code will run. If the condition is false the second code (else) will run.

MODULO (%):
- If we do 23 % 10, we divide 23 by 10 which equals 2 with 3 left over. So 23 % 10 evaluates to 3.

SUBSTRINGS:
- Sometimes you don't want to display the entire string, just a part of it
- "some word".substring(x, y) where X is where you start chopping and Y is where you finish chopping the original string. Y does not appear inside, it stops chopping before it
- e.g.: "hello". substring(0, 2); --> we select H and slice up to L (without L), so we get H and E. *First letter position is 0!!!*
- space is numbered as well!

VARIABLES:
- To do more complex coding, we need a way to 'save' the values from our coding. We do this by defining a variable with a specific, case-sensitive name. Once you create (or declare) a variable as having a particular name, you can then call up that value by typing the variable name.
- var varName = data;
- So the variable stores the value of the variable, whether that is a number or a string
- Change variable values: you call the variable and type in the new data
e.g: var myAge = "thirty"; myAge = "thirty-one"; --> now the value of var myAge is thirty-one
